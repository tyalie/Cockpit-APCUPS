# Cockpit UPS Status

A status overview for APC UPSs using apcupsd

# Getting and building the source

Make sure you have `npm` available (usually from your distribution package).
These commands check out the source and build it into the `dist/` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/cockpit-project/starter-kit.git
cd starter-kit
make
```

# Installing

`make install` compiles and installs the package in `/usr/share/cockpit/`. The
convenience targets `srpm` and `rpm` build the source and binary rpms,
respectively. Both of these make use of the `dist-gzip` target, which is used
to generate the distribution tarball. In `production` mode, source files are
automatically minified and compressed. Set `NODE_ENV=production` if you want to
duplicate this behavior.

For development, you usually want to run your module straight out of the git
tree. To do that, link that to the location were `cockpit-bridge` looks for packages:

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/cockpit
ln -s `pwd`/dist ~/.local/share/cockpit/starter-kit
```

After changing the code and running `make` again, reload the Cockpit page in
your browser.

You can also use
[watch mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-watch-mode) to
automatically update the webpack on every code change with

    $ npm run watch

or

    $ make watch

# Running eslint

Cockpit Starter Kit uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically check
JavaScript code style in `.js` and `.jsx` files.

The linter is executed within every build as a webpack preloader.

For developer convenience, the ESLint can be started explicitly by:

    $ npm run eslint

Violations of some rules can be fixed automatically by:

    $ npm run eslint:fix

Rules configuration can be found in the `.eslintrc.json` file.
